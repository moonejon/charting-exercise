# MLB Win Tracker

**Click Here -->** https://flamboyant-shockley-033a04.netlify.app

This application displays up-to-date win counts for MLB teams, organized by division.

The user has the option of viewing the data in either a bar chart or pie chart format, toggled via a button in the upper right-hand corner.

In bar chart mode, you can view exact win counts per team by hovering over that team's bar. Per requirements for clearly differentiating between hover and click states, clicking on each bar flips its color between black and the team's primary color scheme. 

In pie chart mode, all of the data is easily viewable by the user and there is no hover/click functionality.
